# Project README

## Overview

This project is inspired by the principles of the R `tidymodels` framework but implemented in Python. The primary goal is to provide a cohesive and streamlined approach to data analysis and modeling in Python, leveraging the tidy principles that have made `tidymodels` so popular in the R community.

## Features

- **Tidy Data Principles**: Emphasizing the importance of tidy data where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
- **Modular Design**: Components are designed to work together seamlessly, allowing users to mix and match parts according to their needs.
- **Consistent API**: A consistent and intuitive API across all modules to facilitate ease of learning and use.
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new models, preprocessing steps, and utilities.
- **Integration with Popular Libraries**: Built to work well with popular Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and others.

## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install topmodels
```

## Getting Started

Here is a basic example to illustrate how to use this package:

```python
import mypackage as mp

# Load data
data = mp.load_data('my_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess data
preprocessor = mp.Preprocessor()
data_clean = preprocessor.fit_transform(data)

# Split data
train, test = mp.split_data(data_clean, test_size=0.2)

# Define model
model = mp.models.LinearRegression()

# Train model
model.fit(train)

# Evaluate model
evaluation = model.evaluate(test)

print(evaluation)
```
